## Development Standards/Style

This project complies with the Google Style Guides for [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), [JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), and [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html). You can use the [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) tool to help you comply with the Google Java Style Guide. You can use the tool with most major IDEs such as Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ.

In general for all files we use a column/line width of 80 whenever possible and we use 2 spaces for indentation. All files must end with a new line. Please adjust the formatting settings of your IDE accordingly. You are encouraged but not required to use HTML Tidy and CSS Tidy to help format your code.

## Roadmap
The project is currently stable with no major releases planned in the short term until Jakarta EE 11 is released and well adopted.
